=== What ===

A giant pile of shaders from various apps, for whatever purpose.  In
particular, we use it to capture assembly output of the shader
compiler for analysis of regressions in compiler behavior.

=== Capturing shaders ===
env MESA_GLSL=dump appname |& tee log
./split-to-files.py appname log
# clean up resulting files, as the parsing is just an assist, not actually
# complete.
$EDITOR shaders/appname/*

=== Running shaders ===
# We rely on piglit binaries to actually execute the shader code.
# Replace this path with wherever you actually built piglit.
ln -s $HOME/src/piglit/bin ./

# this relies on i965 driver debug output, hack it up for anything else.
./run.py shaders/*/* |& tee new-run

=== Analysis ===
./result.py old-run new-run
