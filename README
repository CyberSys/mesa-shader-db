=== What ===

A giant pile of shaders from various apps, for whatever purpose.  In
particular, we use it to capture assembly output of the shader
compiler for analysis of regressions in compiler behavior.

=== Capturing shaders ===
env MESA_GLSL=dump appname |& tee log
split-to-files.pl appname log
# clean up resulting files, as the parsing is just an assist, not actually
# complete.
$EDITOR shaders/appname/*

=== Running shaders ===
# set your location to hacked glslparsertest that links shaders.
$EDITOR run.pl
# this relies on i965 driver debug output, hack it up for anything else.
./run.pl shaders/**/*.frag

=== Analysis ===
diff old-run new-run
